checkm/checkm-1.2.0:
    Version: 1.2.0
    Source: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/checkm-genome%3A1.2.0--pyhdfd78af_0
    Notes: Checkm databases are included in the container at /usr/local/checkm_data
    Working: Yes
    
dram/dram-1.3.5:
    Version: 1.3.5

    Notes: 
    Working: Untested
    
flye/flye-2.9:
    Version: 2.9
    Description: Flye is a de novo DNA sequence assembler that assembles longer sequences of DNA from fragments. De novo means that the assembly is based on the overlap between fragments rather than by reference to a database of known sequences.

    Notes: 
    Working: Untested
    
medaka/medaka-1.6.0:
    Version: 1.6.0
    Description: Medaka improves draft seqences assembled by Flye 
    Source: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/medaka%3A1.6.0--py38h84d2cc8_0
    Notes: 
      - The medaka_consensus binary runs medaka with a set of default parameters.
      - The tensorflow library creates some warnings on the command line but these can be ignored
      - The trained models used for the machine learning component don't seem to be included in the container but these can be downloaded and referenced easily. 
    Working: Yes
    
medaka/medaka-1.6.0_ubuntu: 
    Version: 1.6.0
    Source: medaka-1.6.0_custom.def
    Notes: Custom install based on Ubuntu is much larger than docker image.
    Working: No - modern versions of Tensorflow neex AVX instructions which requires changing the CPU type in the VM.

    Notes: No known existing container
    Working: Untested
    
metawrap/metawrap-1.2:
    Version: 1.2
    Source: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/metawrap%3A1.2--hdfd78af_2
    Notes: Relies on an old version of Checkm. Checkm requires access to database files which are not linked correctly in the image.
    Working: No
    
porechop/porechop-0.2.4:
    Version: 0.2.4
    Description: Porechop trims adaptors from seqenced DNA fragments. This is a data cleaning step that is conducted after experimental sequencing, before assembly is attempted.
    Input: One or more files in FASTQ/FASTA/FASTQ.gz/FASTA.gz format.
    Output: One FASTQ/FASTA/FASTQ.gz/FASTA.gz file for each input file.
    Source: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/porechop%3A0.2.4--py39hc16433a_3
    Notes: 
    Working: Partly - can't add new adpators to container as adaptor file is hard coded.
    Example use: porechop -i input_reads.fastq -o output_reads.fastq
    
prokka/prokka-1.14.6:
    Version: 1.14.6

    Version: 3.13.0
    Source: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/roary%3A3.13.0--pl526h516909a_0
    Notes: 
      - Results must be output to a directory to which you have write access.
      - There is a warning message about locales. This is not a problem but can be supressed using the command `export LC_ALL=C`
    Working: Yes
