flye/flye-2.9.sif
    Version: 2.9
    Description: Flye is a de novo DNA sequence assembler that assembles longer sequences of DNA from fragments. De novo means that the assembly is based on the overlap between fragments rather than by reference to a database of known sequences.

porechop/porechop-0.2.4.sif:
    Version: 0.2.4
    Description: Porechop trims adaptors from seqenced DNA fragments. This is a data cleaning step that is conducted after experimental sequencing, before assembly is attempted.
    Input: One or more files in FASTQ/FASTA/FASTQ.gz/FASTA.gz format.
    Output: One FASTQ/FASTA/FASTQ.gz/FASTA.gz file for each input file.
    Source: porechop/porechop-0.2.4.def
    Notes: To add new adaptors, add them to adaptors.py file and rebuild the container. 
    Working: Yes
    Example use: porechop -i input_reads.fastq -o output_reads.fastq
